<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Cardiac Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Heart Valves</li><li>Biological/Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Transcatheter Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial cardiac valves market consists of three main types: mechanical heart valves, biological (or tissue) heart valves, and transcatheter heart valves. Mechanical heart valves are durable and designed for long-term use, typically made from materials like carbon or titanium. Biological valves, sourced from animal or human tissue, offer a more natural function but may require replacement after a certain period. Transcatheter heart valves are minimally invasive options implanted via catheter, making them suitable for patients at higher surgical risk. Each type addresses specific patient needs and conditions.</p></p>
