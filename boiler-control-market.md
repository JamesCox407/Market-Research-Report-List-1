<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boiler Control Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Modulating Control</li><li>On/Off Control</li><li>High-fire/low-fire Control</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The boiler control market encompasses various control types tailored to optimize efficiency and performance. Modulating control adjusts the burner output continuously based on demand, enhancing energy efficiency. On/Off control operates the burner in a binary fashion, turning it fully on or off, which can lead to less precise temperature regulation. High-fire/low-fire control provides two operational stages, allowing for reduced energy consumption while maintaining a stable output. Each control type offers distinct advantages based on application needs and operational efficiency.</p></p>
