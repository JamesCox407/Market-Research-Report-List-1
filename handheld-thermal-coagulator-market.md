<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Thermal Coagulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar Coagulator</li><li>Multipolar Coagulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld thermal coagulator market consists primarily of two types: unipolar and multipolar coagulators. Unipolar coagulators use a single electrode and require a grounding pad to facilitate current flow, making them suitable for various surgical applications. In contrast, multipolar coagulators utilize multiple electrodes to deliver energy directly to the tissue, allowing for more precise control and localized treatment. Both types are integral in minimally invasive procedures, enhancing surgical efficiency and reducing tissue damage during coagulation.</p></p>
