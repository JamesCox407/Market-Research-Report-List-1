<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilator Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open</li><li>Semi-Open</li><li>Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ventilator circuits market is categorized into three types: open, semi-open, and closed circuits. Open circuits allow ambient air to mix with the delivered gases, promoting a more natural breathing environment. Semi-open circuits combine some closed elements while still permitting gas exchange with the atmosphere. Closed circuits, on the other hand, are fully contained systems that minimize environmental exposure, enhancing gas retention and reducing contamination. Each type serves specific clinical needs and patient scenarios in respiratory care.</p></p>
