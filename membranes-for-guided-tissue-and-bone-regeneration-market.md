<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membranes for Guided Tissue and Bone Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-resorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The guided tissue and bone regeneration market encompasses two main types of membranes: absorbable and non-resorbable. Absorbable membranes are designed to dissolve over time, promoting tissue regeneration without requiring additional surgery for removal, making them convenient for patients. Non-resorbable membranes, on the other hand, provide a durable barrier for extended periods, typically necessitating a second procedure for removal. Both types play crucial roles in preventing soft tissue ingrowth and facilitating the growth of bone and periodontal tissues in regenerative procedures.</p></p>
